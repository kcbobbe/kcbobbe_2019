                    Q-seum is a mobile-first web application that allows museum membership holders a way to check in using QR codes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I worked on this project with three other team members.
                    Two of us worked on front end, and the other two worked on the Ruby on Rails back end.
                    This project was completed in 3 weeks using an Agile development process.
                  </p>
                  <h5><strong>Why build Q-seum?</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                      One member of our team has experience working at the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, North Carolina.
                      One of the long standing problems at the museum is the long lines for entering the museum.
                      Museum members pay an annual membership fee, so they don't need to pay admission each time they visit the museum.
                      We built Q-seum to provide a fast-track for check in to the museum.
                  </p>
                  <p style="width: 70%; margin: 1rem auto 1rem auto; border: 2px solid #333333">
                    <img  src="images/Q-seum.png">
                  </p>
                <h5><strong>Using Q-seum</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                    From the landing page of Q-seum, a user can choose to login, register, or purchase admission.
                    Existing museum members can create a Q-seum account by registering using their museum membership number.
                    In order to register, members must also provide a selfie so that museum employees can confirm their identity upon check in.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Once a member logs in, they are brought to their home page.
                    This home page features the user's profile picture and their personalized QR code.
                    When a member wants to enter the museum, they just need to show a museum employee this screen for scanning.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When a museum employee scans the member's QR code, they are brought to that user's specific check in page.
                    This page is only accessible by museum employees with admin privileges.
                  </p>
                  <h5><strong>Checking in a museum guest</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                    The first time a museum employee checks in a member, they must validate the member's selife.
                    This involves the employee checking the photo and name shown on the check in page with the member's photo ID.
                    This step is important to ensure the member does not lend out their registration information to others.
                    Future visits will not require this validate selfie step.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, the museum employee will select the number of guests to check in.
                    The number of guests that are permitted entry with a single membership is determined by the member's membership type.
                    Finally, the employee will press 'check in'. 
                    This logs the visit with the member's information and date of visit.
                    This visit information could be used by employees to analyze visit data.
                  </p>
                  <h5><strong>Purchasing Admission</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                    The primary focus of Q-seum was to provide museum members with a way to easily check in to the museum using a QR Code.
                    As we completed development of this feature, we decided to tackle another problem that the museum faces.
                    Currently, the Museum of Life and Science in Durham does not have a way for guests to pre-purchase or gift admission to the museum.
                    We added the ability for users to easily purchase admission for themselves or others through Q-seum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back on the landing page of Q-seum there is an option to pre-purchase admission.
                    Anyone can purchase admission using this feature, even without a Q-seum account or a museum membership.
                    A user can select the number and type of tickets that they would like to purchase.
                    Then, the user can choose to send the tickets to themselves or to a recipient.
                    Finally, the user will pay the balance of the tickets by entering their credit card information.
                    This information is tokenized, validated, and processed using <a href="#">Stripe</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the purchase is successful, the tickets will be emailed to the recipient.
                    The email contains a one-use QR Code.
                    Upon scanning, the visitor can be checked in and QR Code will be marked as invalid.
                  </p>
                  <h5><strong>The design of Q-seum</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                    Our application was built to be used almost exclusively on mobile devices, so we designed this application with that in mind.
                    We made buttons and the menu easy to navigate on mobile devices.
                    Throughout development, we favored using mobile emulators and physical mobile devices instead of browsers to test our design.
                    At several points in development, we had user testing.
                    We were able to adjust our UI to accommodate different devices and suggestions from our testers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of our design choices were influenced by the museum itself.
                    Our bright color scheme and forest background was inspired by the whimsy and natural environment of the museum.
                    Our orange QR code frog was inspired by poison dart frogs that I saw at the museum.
                    I was thinking all about QR codes, that when I saw the frog I thought to myself "That frog looks like it has a QR code on its back".
                  </p>
                  <h5><strong>Why choose not to build a native app?</strong></h5>
                    Before starting development, we had a discussion about whether we should make Q-seum a native app, or to make it a mobile first web application.
                    There are several reasons why a native app would be beneficial, including a more immersive user experience.
                    Learning React Native is a skill that I want to develop, but with a 3 week deadline, we would have had to cut or rush some of Q-seum's features.
                    We decided to build upon our current skills in React.js to build the most polished, feature-rich web application possible within our deadline of 3 weeks.
